Hello! I'm Manu Chintalapathi, I'm currently a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside currently studying Computer Science.

I'm interested in learning new languages and competitive programming, and I hope to contribute to a start-up in the future.

I'm also interested in collaborating on coding projects with other like-minded individuals, so if you need to contact me for that or other business purposes
send me an email @ --> manu.chintalapathi@gmail.com

As of this current moment, this space is going to be used to post previous high school work I did in the past and college-level work that I'm currently
learning. Enjoy! (Don't be afraid to reach out)
